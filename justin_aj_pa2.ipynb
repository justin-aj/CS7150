        "## Overview\n",
        "<font size='4'> In this assignment you will practice putting together a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classification pipeline. So far we have worked with deep fully-connected networks, using them to explore different optimization strategies and network architectures. Fully-connected networks are a good testbed for experimentation because they are computationally efficient, but in practice CNNs work better for image classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "<font size='4'>In the first part , you will implement several layer types that are used in convolutional networks using Numpy. In the second part, you will then implement a custom CNN and ones based on the ResNet using PyTorch. You will also practice hyper parameter tuning to achieve desired accuracy.\n",
